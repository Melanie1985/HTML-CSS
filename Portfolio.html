    </div>
    <div>
        <p>For this exercise we were asked to write a program to ask a student for their percentage mark and convert this to a grade. Firstly I gave the function a name and then started to work out the best way to go about making the code as simple as possible. I decided that I would use if, elif and else statements to give the user the different parameters that I had set. After I had set these I then asked the user to input their mark so that I could use a variable to turn the mark into an interger which was then printed on screen. Next I created another function to find out what the students target grade was and compared it against their actual grade given. I once again set the parameters for the target grade using if, elif and else statements and gave each parameter a statement to print if the correct ruling applied. I then asked the user to enter their target grade, this is printed along with the users actual grade using a variable I created. I really enjoyed the challenge this exercise gave me and I feel like I learnt a lot by completing it</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/Melanie1985/Python/blob/main/Palindrome">Github Palindrome Python exercise</a>
    </div>
   
    <div>
        <p>I wrote a very simple but efficient program which asked a user to input any word and the program would determine whether the word was a Palindrome or not. I started by asking the user to input a string (word). I then used an if statement to ask if the word given was equal to the same word but in reverse order by using the string reverse method. If the word was a Palindrome then the program would print that it was and if it wasn't the program would use the elese statement and print that it wasn't. I enjoyed doing the research needed to work out the best way to write this program.  </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I was asked to write a program to work out if a password is weak, medium or strong. I decided that I was going to make this a simple program and just use the length of a password to determine its strength. I first asked the user to enter their password, I then asked them to inout the password again so that we could check that it matched. I used if, elif and else statements along with the len function to set my parameters. I decided that if the length of the passowrd was greater or equal to 16 characters then the password was strong. I then decided that if the password given was greater or equal to 10 characters then it was medium and anything under 10 characters would be considered weak.The program would print out the 3 different statements based on the password length. This exercise encouraged me to find out about the different functions one could use for determining different scenarios in a program.</p>

    <h3>Using HTML and CSS to create this webpage!!</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>For the past few weeks I have been learning how HTML and CSS is used to create a webpage and these 3 pages are proof of that. There are many different aspects to building a webpage most of which I am really enjoying and I find it both challenging and rewarding. I hope that you enjoy reading it as much as I did creating it!!</p>
