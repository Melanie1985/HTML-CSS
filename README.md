# HTML-CSS

- Project No. 1 - About Me Page (index)
- BRIEF - We were asked to create an 'About Me' page, which will be the first page of a 3 page site for your portfolio.
- USING HTML & CSS IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - See each file for sudo code
- CHALLENGES FACED - I ran into some trouble early on as I was getting a lot of syntax errors and no matter how many times I read through my code it seemed to look fine but wouldn't work the way I wanted it to.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read through my code a lot, A LOT and it would be something so small, that it frustrated me so bad. But I was also relieved that I managed to work it out myself and it helped me in the following weeks as I did not make the same mistakes again.
