# HTML-CSS

- Project No. 1 - About Me Page (index)
- BRIEF - We were asked to create an 'About Me' page, which will be the first page of a 3 page site for your portfolio.
- USING HTML & CSS IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - See each file for sudo code
- CHALLENGES FACED - I ran into some trouble early on as I was getting a lot of syntax errors and no matter how many times I read through my code it seemed to look fine but wouldn't work the way I wanted it to.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read through my code a lot, A LOT and it would be something so small, that it frustrated me so bad. But I was also relieved that I managed to work it out myself and it helped me in the following weeks as I did not make the same mistakes again.

- Project No. 2 - Portfolio page
- BRIEF - We were asked to continue with our 'About Me' page and also add in a Portfolio Page which will showcase the projects we've worked on. Then link it to our github accounts. 
- USING HTML & CSS IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - See each file for sudo code
- CHALLENGES FACED - I stuggled to imagine what I wanted this page to look like, should I have lots of information on each exercise, what I did, how I did it or shall I jsut have images with links to all of that information.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I looked at a lot of different websites with portfolios on to get some ideas and to see what looked good. I decided on having images with links to click onto as this seemed like it was the most aesthetically pleaseing thing to do.

- Project No. 3 - Contact page
- BRIEF - We were asked to continue working on our 3 page website. Create a contact us page also. 
- USING HTML & CSS IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - See each file for sudo code
- CHALLENGES FACED - I couldn't really work out how I wanted this page to look as I wanted it to be simple and easy to use and fill out.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - Again I did some research and looked at how other contact forms were presented. This helped me decide on what the most important details were needed from the user.
